##Instagram OAuth
This is an application that uses Instagram's OAuth API to display all the images the logged on user has taken near them.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript ES6 +

So you know how when you try to sign up for a new website and you click on, for instance "sign in with Instagram"? Do you know what's happening behind the scenes? Well, for this project I used Instagram's OAuth API to access the user's information in order to display pictures taken around their location. When the user clicks the button, they are redirected to Instagram's authentication page where they are required to enter their password and login information. After the user logs in they are redirected to my application with an access token.
